# Internship-at-ICISE-IFIRSE---Neutrino-Group
Repository for simulation and classification of neutrino events in Water Cherenkov detector

This repository was created for the my 2-months internship at the ICISE/IFIRSE - Neutrino Group, Vietnam under the supervision of Dr. Son Cao. It has followed my first year of Master at the University of Science and Technology of Hanoi.

This is the repository for all codes used for the following tasks:
  - analyze the data
  - display the images for first PID (e-/mu and e-/gamma)
  -  run scripts for classifying events

The simulation of Water Cherenkov neutrino events has been performed using the WCSim package of the GEANT4 software (see https://github.com/WCSim/WCSim). The installation was made using Docker.
